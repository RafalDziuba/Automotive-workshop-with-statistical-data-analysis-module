# Engineering projece

Hello!

## What it is?
This app collects orders, generates statistics and analyzes them. There is some of statistical methods, if you're interested here You can see more about them:
1. Chi-square: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/
2. V-Cramer: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cognos-analytics/11.1.0?topic=terms-cramrs-v \
\
There You can see a lot of working with DOM, events **and API skills**. To write this project, I used Vanilla JS. 

## Features:
1. Login/logut 
2. Adding orders
3. Preview all orders, delete them and view details
4. Statistical insights with analysis and intepretation, based on orders

I know, that this project needs a huge refactoring, and there is a lot of bad practices (code repeating for example) - I'm aware of that. 
In future, when I learn React enough, I will rewrite this whole project in React (I'm currently learning it). 
Live version isn't available at this moment. Below You can see some screenshots from this project:
